"Cyber Abuse Detection in Roman Urdu using Machine Learning"

This project aims to detect **cyber abuse and offensive language** in **Roman Urdu** text using **Machine Learning** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques. It was developed as part of my **Machine Learning Internship Project**.

# Project Overview

With the rapid growth of social media, incidents of **cyber harassment, bullying, and offensive language** have also increased, particularly in informal languages such as **Roman Urdu**.  
This project presents a **machine learning-based approach** to automatically detect abusive comments from social media text.

The system processes real-world data, applies **NLP techniques**, trains multiple **ML models**, and compares their performance.  
A **web interface (Flask-based)** is also developed to allow users to test the model in real time.

# Dataset

The dataset consists of **5,000+ Roman Urdu comments** manually labeled as:
- **H** â†’ Hate(Abusive)  
- **O** â†’ Ordinary(Non-Abusive)

# Machine Learning Models Used

| Algorithm | Description | Purpose |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| Logistic Regression | Linear classifier for text classification | Baseline model |
| NaÃ¯ve Bayes | Probabilistic model for text data | Fast and interpretable |
| SVM | High-performance classifier for complex data | Effective for NLP tasks |

# Evaluation Metrics

- **Accuracy**  
- **Precision**  
- **Recall**  
- **F1 Score**

All models were compared visually using bar charts and graphs to highlight performance differences.
